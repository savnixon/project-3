            My name is Savanna Nixon, I am a Graphic Design major at LSU. A little about myself would be that I am 20 years old and I am from New Orleans, Louisiana.  I am currently working at a small boutique in Baton Rouge called Moxi and also at the WaterMark hotel in downtown Baton Rouge. When I am not at school or working I love spending time at places like City Park, The Fly, and the pool. Some traits I would say I hold are being open minded, creative, compassionate, genuine, and honesty. I am always working on being a better me. Some hobbies I enjoy doing when I am free from work and school are journaling, shopping, seeing live music, hanging out with friends, working out, and watching movies. On the weekends I usually like to go to dinner to get some drinks and hangout or go to out with friends. In the future I see myself leaving Louisiana and creating a new life somewhere new.
